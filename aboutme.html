    <p>My name is Jared Macatumbas. I am 15 years old. I study in PSHS SMC. I like to procrasti- I mean spend my free time by playing games like pokemon, watching videos on youtube, and scrolling through X. I like contemplating about my purpose within the universe and how it means nothing as we are insignificant in the grand scheme of all things</p>
    <p>Thinking about how life is meaningless having all things considered; our life span being miniscule compared to the duration of the universe. How we'll inevitably spend more time in the void known as death than in the joys of life and how we will never be certain if there is a heaven or afterlife at all.</p>

    <p>I like owls. I think they're nice.</p>
